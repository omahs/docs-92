UNAVI is an open and decentralized web-based metaverse platform.

UNAVI reimagines the web as an **interconnected network of 3D spaces**, instead of 2D pages - all while running on open standards and decentralized infrastructure. You can access UNAVI on desktop or mobile devices, with VR support planned in the future.

## ðŸ”“ An Open Platform

The goal of UNAVI is to create a platform that can be built upon by others on every level, from the protocol to the client to the servers. We are tired of walled gardens and proprietary platforms - we want to create a platform that is **truly open**, a platform that anyone can build upon, expirement with, and over time a platform that can evolve as the community adopts new features.

The [UNAVI codebase](https://github.com/unavi-xyz/unavi) is fully open source, and the platform is built on top of an open protocol called [The Wired](https://github.com/wired-protocol/spec). Anyone can run their own servers, modify their client, and extend the protocol to add additional features without being isolated from the rest of the network.
