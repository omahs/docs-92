## DIDs

The Wired uses [decentralized identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier) (DIDs) to handle user identity.
Currently UNAVI supports [did\:web](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/).

## TODO

- Authentication (verify another player's identity within a world)
- Portable handle system (likely using domains, `@alice.unavi.xyz`)
- Social features (friends list, following, blocking, etc)
