UNAVI is an open and decentralized 3D platform built for the web.

UNAVI reimagines the web as an **interconnected network of 3D worlds**, instead of 2D pages - all while running on open standards and decentralized infrastructure.
You can access UNAVI on any device with a web browser - desktop, mobile, and soonâ„¢ VR.
