The goal of UNAVI is to create a platform that can be built upon by others on every level, from the protocol to the client to the servers.
We are tired of walled gardens and proprietary platforms - we want to create a platform that is **truly open**, a platform that anyone can build upon,
expirement with, and over time a platform that can evolve as the community adopts new features.

## The Wired

[The Wired](https://github.com/wired-protocol/spec) is an open and extendable protocol for creating, hosting, and interacting with 3D virtual worlds.
It is the base layer that everything is built upon - describing what worlds are, how the client and server should communicate, how user identity is handled, and more.

## UNAVI 

[UNAVI](https://github.com/unavi-xyz/unavi) is an open source client and server built upon The Wired.
